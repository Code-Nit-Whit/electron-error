**Electron-Error Module Documentation**

**1. Introduction**

The ElectronError module provides exported functions and custom classes to enhance error reporting and enable more robust error handling within Electron applications. Central to this module are the `ElectronError` class, which extends the standard `Error` class, and the `ElectronContext` class, which adds additioanl information to the custom error object for improved handling nd debugging capabilities.

**2. ElectronError Class**

The `ElectronError` class serves as a wrapper for standard errors, enriching them with additional context and custom properties. Key features of the `ElectronError` class include:

- Extension of the standard `Error` class to maintain compatibility and familiarity.
- Additional properties that can be utilized to provide implement simpler error handling logic in projects.  
- Inclusion of an `electronContext` property to provide detailed context and metadata about the error and environment.  
- Construction of custom error objects utilizing any thrown standard errors, enhancing error reporting capabilities. 
- Ease of use as a stadalone. Simply place `throwElectronErr(error);`, an exported function of this module, in your `catch` blocks to use the `ElectronError` insance as a standalone tool for  debugging or logging. 

Key data points contained in an `ElectronError` instance include:

- [fill this in using jsdoc and the schema]

**3. ElectronContext Class**

The `ElectronContext` class is responsible for dynamically building the `electronContext` property of an `ElectonError` instance.  and utilizing schemas to validate the structure of the `electronContext` object returned by the `CustomError` class. Key functionalities and features of the `ElectronContext` class include:

- Programmatic retrieval of error context information to populate the `electronContext` object.
- Facilitation of easy testing of the `ElectronError` class output against the schema to ensure data integrity and type correctness.
- Utility as a standablone tool. Place this mudules exported function `getElectroncontext()` in your project's code to return the onject for programmatic use. You also configure the function to automatically log the object to the console or a file by passing through the right parameters. See below for more information.

**6. Conclusion**

The Electron-Error module offers a comprehensive approach to error reporting and handling in Electron applications. By combining the `CustomError` class with dynamic schema building and validation capabilities provided by the `ElectronContext` class, developers can ensure robust error handling, streamlined development workflows, and enhanced usability of their Electron applications.
