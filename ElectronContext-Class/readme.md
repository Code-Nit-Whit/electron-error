**Schema Building Approach**

The schema-building approach implemented by the `ElectronContext` class follows a progressive and iterative process, aligning with the development lifecycle. The process involves:

- Continuous addition of properties and sub-properties to the schema as new information is gathered during class development.
- Utilization of the `addToSchema` function to dynamically update the schema based on the evolving structure of the `electronContext` object.
- Integration of schema validation mechanisms into the development workflow to ensure consistency and accuracy in error reporting and handling.

**Production Readiness and Schema Utilization**

Once the `CustomError` class reaches a stable and tested state, a production-ready version will be created. This version will:

- Exclude the schema-building logic to streamline the module and optimize performance.
- Incorporate schema validation mechanisms to check user-provided inputs against the finalized schema, ensuring data integrity and type consistency.
- Leverage the schema as a documentation tool to provide insights into the expected structure of the `electronContext` object, facilitating ease of use for developers.
